# Creating an application with a Python code sample

**Note:** The Python code sample version `2.0.0` uses the **8080** HTTP port.

Before you begin creating an application with this `devfile` code sample, it's helpful to understand the relationship between the `devfile` and `Dockerfile` and how they contribute to your build. You can find these files at the following URLs:

- [Python Sample `devfile.yaml`](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-python-basic/blob/v2.0.0/devfile.yaml)
- [Python Sample `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-python-basic/blob/v2.0.0/docker/Dockerfile)
- [Parent Python Stack `devfile.yaml`](https://github.com/devfile/registry/blob/main/stacks/python/3.0.0/devfile.yaml)

This code sample inherits the components and commands of the specified parent devfile. The sample devfile overrides and extends parts of the parent devfile, in this case parts of the `deploy` component.

1. The parent `devfile.yaml` file has an [`build` component](https://github.com/devfile/registry/blob/main/stacks/python/3.0.0/devfile.yaml#L39-L45) that points to your `Dockerfile`.
2. The [`docker/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-python-basic/blob/v2.0.0/docker/Dockerfile) contains the instructions you need to build the code sample as a container image.
3. The `devfile.yaml` [`deploy` component](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-python-basic/blob/v2.0.0/devfile.yaml#L25-L37) overrides the parent `deploy` and points to a `deploy.yaml` file that contains instructions for deploying the built container image.
4. The parent `devfile.yaml` [`deploy` command](https://github.com/devfile/registry/blob/main/stacks/python/3.0.0/devfile.yaml#L82-L89) completes the [outerloop](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop) deployment phase by pointing to the `build` and `deploy` components to create your application.
